Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) is crucial for addressing the uncertainty of input variables in complex systems. However, traditional methods are inefficient and difficult to interpret when dealing with high-dimensional outputs. This paper introduces a GSA method that combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE). PCA is used for dimensionality reduction, decreasing the complexity of multivariate and high-dimensional outputs, while PCE accurately estimates Sobol's indices through polynomial expansion. This method not only improves computational efficiency and interpretability but also effectively addresses the sensitivity analysis of high-dimensional correlated outputs. Validated through a pile case, the PCA-PCE to calculate the Sobol's indices demonstrates significant advantages in handling complex multivariate and high-dimensional correlated outputs.
